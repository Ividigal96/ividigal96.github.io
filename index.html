    <h1>The Wolf</h1>

    <p>The wolf, also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. 
        More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, 
        comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies
    </p>

    <p>
        Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate. 
        A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another. 
        Some howls are confrontational. Calls may be answered by rival packs. Much like barking domestic dogs, 
        wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun.
